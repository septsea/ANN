~~## Getting Started~~

~~Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code~~ ~~in Visual Studio Code.~~

~~## Folder Structure~~

~~The workspace contains two folders by default, where:~~

~~- `src`: the folder to maintain sources~~
~~- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies~~

~~## Dependency Management~~

~~The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found~~ ~~[here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0~~.~~md#work-with-jar-files-directly).~~

Well, this is just school work...

Just open this by anything you like.

There are some executable Java files in [`src/learning/test`](src/learning/test/). Run them to see the outputs.

Expected outputs:

- `Problem24.java`:

```text
(1)

W(3) = [0.0, -7.0]
net(4) = -7.0
W(4) = [-1.0, -8.0]

(2)
